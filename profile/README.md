## 🏗️ Technical Ecosystem & Standards

We maintain a high engineering bar across three core pillars:

### 1. Frontend (React)
* **Architecture:** Feature-based modularity.
* **Standards:** 100% test coverage (Vitest), Atomic Design (Storybook), and strict ESLint boundaries.

### 2. Backend (Java / Spring Boot)
* **Architecture:** Clean Architecture / Hexagonal principles.
* **Standards:** JUnit/Mockito for unit testing, integration tests for API contracts, and Checkstyle for code consistency.

### 3. Infrastructure (Terraform)
* **Approach:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
* **Standards:** Modular Terraform code, automated plan/apply via CI/CD, and "random provider" usage for secure, auto-generated secrets.
